                network, and we share your information with them, subject to
                contractual confidentiality restrictions, in order to attempt to
                provide the services requested. If you use our services pursuant
                to a membership with one of our partners, we may share your
                service request activity information with such partner. We may

                for past due service professional accounts.

              <li>

                RADOVEY LTD or our services, we may share personal information
                with the businesses with which we partner to offer you those
                products, services, promotions, contests. When you elect to

              </li>

                <strong>Business transfers:</strong>&nbsp;As we continue to
                develop our business, we might sell or buy companies,
                subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer
                information generally is one of the transferred business assets
                but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing
                Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the customer consents
                otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that RADOVEY LTD or our
                services, we may share personal information or substantially all
                of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course
                be one of the transferred assets.

              <li>
                <strong>Protection of RADOVEY LTD and others:</strong>&nbsp;We
                release account and other personal information when we believe
                release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply
                our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the
                rights, property, or safety of RADOVEY LTD, our users, or
                others. This includes exchanging information with other
                companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk
                reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling,
                renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally
                identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes
                in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy
                Policy.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>With your consent:</strong>&nbsp;Other than as set out
                above, you will receive notice when information about you might
                go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose
                not to share the information.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Other Situations:</strong> <br />We also may disclose your
              information:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a
                court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement
                or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal
                rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required
                by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection
                or right available to us, in our sole discretion.
              </li>
              <li>
                When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with
                efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding
                illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to
                protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our
                company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with
                applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce
                RADOVEY LTD terms and conditions or other agreements or
                policies.
              </li>
              <li>
                In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as
                the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation,
                or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In addition, we may share aggregated or anonymous information
              collected through the website, including Personal Information that
              has been de-identified, with third parties, including advisors,
              advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general
              business analysis. For example, we may inform our advertisers

              they conduct while on our site.

              If you have an online consumer account with us, you have the
              ability to review and update your personal information online by

              personal information by contacting us. More information about how
              to contact us is provided below.

            <p>
              You can also choose to have your account disabled by contacting
              support@radovey.com. After you deactivate your account, you will
              not be able to sign in to our website or access any personal

              you deactivate your account, we may retain some information
              associated with your account for internal purposes including
              backups, fraud prevention, dispute resolution, investigations, and
              RADOVEY LTD terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.
            </p>
            <h4>Your Choices About Collection and Use of Your Information</h4>
            <p>
              You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but
              that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our
              website because such information may be required in order for you
              to register as a member; purchase products or services;
              participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a
              question; or initiate other transactions on our website.
            </p>
            <p>
              At any time a user can choose to no longer receive commercial or
              promotional emails or newsletters from us by accessing their
              account settings and opting out. You also will be given the
              opportunity, in any commercial e-mail that we send to you, to opt
              out of receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 10
              business days for us to process an opt-out request. We may send
              you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail
              communications, such as service announcements, administrative
              notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt
              out of receiving them. Please note that changing information in
              your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional
              email communications will only affect future activities or
              communications from us. If we have already provided your
              information to a third party (such as a service provider) before
              you changed your preferences or updated your information, you may
              have to change you preferences directly with that third party.
            </p>
            <h4>How We Protect Your Personal Information</h4>
            <p>
              We take appropriate security measures (including physical,
              electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your
              personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For
              example, only authorized employees are permitted to access
              personal information, and they may do so only for permitted
              business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the
              transmission of your sensitive personal information between your
              system and ours, and we use firewalls and other intrusion
              detection and prevention controls to help prevent unauthorized
              persons from gaining access to your information.
            </p>

            <h6>Your Rights and Choices</h6>
            <p>
              As a California resident you have certain rights with respect to
              the personal information collected by businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Right to Access.</strong> You have the right to receive
              information about the types of personal information that the
              Company collects, uses, discloses, and sells. Specifically, this
              right allows you to ask the Company for the following information:
              (a) the categories of personal information that the Company
              collects about you; (b) the categories of sources from which the
              Company has obtained personal information about you; (c) the
              Company's business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling
              your personal information; (d) the categories of your personal
              information that the Company sells to third parties; (e) the
              categories of third parties that the Company sells your personal
              information to; and (f) the specific pieces of personal
              information that the Company has collected about you. The Company
              must disclose this information to you when you exercise your right
              to know, subject to proper verification of your request.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Right to be Forgotten.</strong> You have the right to
              request that the Company delete any personal information it has
              collected or maintains about you, subject to certain exceptions
              for business purposes outlined in the applicable law. Once the
              Company receives and confirms your verifiable consumer request,
              the Company will delete your personal information from its
              records, unless an exception applies.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Right to Non-Discrimination.</strong> You have the right
              to non-discrimination if you exercise any of your rights under the
              CCPA. If you exercise your rights under the CCPA, the Company,
              pertaining to its good and services, will not do any of the
              following: (a) deny you any goods or services; (b) charge you a
              different price or rate for goods or services, including through
              the use of benefits or imposing penalties; (c) provide to you a
              different level or quality of goods or services; or (d) suggest to
              you that you will receive a different price or rate for goods or
              services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Right to Opt-Out.</strong> You have the right to direct
              the Company to not sell your personal information to third parties
              at any time. The Company only shares information as outlined
              herein. If you choose to opt-out of the sharing of your personal
              information, the Company will no longer send your personal
              information to third parties. You can choose, at any time, to opt
              back in to the sale of your personal information.
            </p>
            <h6>Exercising your Rights</h6>
            <p>
              To exercise your rights to know, access, and be forgotten
              described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to
              the Company by email
              <a href="mailto:support@radovey.com" class="link" target="_blank"
                >support@radovey.com</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              To exercise your rights to Opt-Out, alternatively you may use the
              "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link in the footer of
              website.
            </p>
            <p>
              Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of
              State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a
              verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.
              You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your
              minor child.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may only make a verifiable consumer request to know or for
              access twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer
              request must: (1) Provide sufficient information that allows the
              Company to reasonably verify you are (a) the person about whom the
              Company collected personal information or (b) such person's
              authorized representative. (2) Describe your request with
              sufficient detail that allows the Company to properly understand,
              evaluate, and respond to it.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may require additional information to verify your requests to
              exercise your rights or understand the scope of your request,
              although you will not be required to create any account on RADOVEY
              LTD to submit a request or have it fulfilled. The Company cannot
              respond to your request or provide you with personal information
              if the Company cannot verify your identity or authority to make
              the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
              The Company will only use personal information provided in a
              verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or
              authority to make the request. We are permitted to reject your
              request if we reasonably determined that you are not a resident of
              the State of California.
            </p>
            <h6>Response Timing and Format</h6>
            <p>
              We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45
              days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we
              will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If
              you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response
              to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will
              deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your
              option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month
              period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The
              response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply
              with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we
              will select a format to provide your personal information that is
              readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information
              from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable
              consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly
              unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we
              will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a
              cost estimate before completing your request.
            </p>

              All of our employees that are involved in telephone solicitation
              for RADOVEY LTD are trained, informed, and directed to use the
